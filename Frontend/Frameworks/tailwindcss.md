# Tailwind CSS

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. Instead of writing custom styles, you compose utilities in your HTML to build any design directly in your markup.

- **Responsive by Default:** Mobile-first breakpoints are baked in.
- **Customizable:** Configure colors, fonts, spacing, and more via `tailwind.config.js`.
- **Dark Mode Support:** Built-in dark mode classes.
- **Modern Tooling:** Uses PostCSS and JIT (Just-in-Time) engine for fast builds and smaller output.
- **Ecosystem:** Seamlessly integrates with Headless UI, Tailwind UI, Flowbite, DaisyUI, and more.
